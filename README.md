# SyntheticMicrobialCommunities
Microbial communities were rationally assembled as bioproduction platforms. The metabolic models of a sucrose-secreting Synechococcus elongatus, two strains of Escherichia coli, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Bacillus subtilis were paired in phototroph-heterotroph combinations. 

The code deployed here was developed using MATLAB Inc. Using the academic licence for UC-San Diego.
